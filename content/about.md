I make websites, web-apps, and am passionate about bringing web technologies into the real world.

## Creativity

I have a passion for creativity, beyond creative problem solving. 
I love using technology in creative and engaging ways. I'm passionate about story telling, [designing escape rooms](/portfolio/20000-leagues), and writing. And I think it is best when these can be combined together to create powerful immersive experience both online and in the real world.

And if you like formal qualification, I have a degree in Digital Screen Arts from The University College of the Creative Arts.

## Technical

For most of my website projects I use WordPress or Drupal, but I'm also keen to promote the expansion of web technologies beyond the web, like with [Ever After](/portfolio/ever-after) where I created an interactive exhibition running on a series of web pages.

Like acronyms and buzz-words? Here's a list of the main technologies and tools I use:

- PHP
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- Python
- Wordpress
- Drupal
- React
- Vue (with NUXT)
- CSS with SASS/LESS
- Adobe Creative Suite/Cloud
- Gimp/Inkscape
- CLI video editing using FFMPEG and MLT/MELD
- LAMP stack administration
- AWS (S3, RDS, Cloudfront)
- Cloudflare (including Workers/Pages)
- General DNS
