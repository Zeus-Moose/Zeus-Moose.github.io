I make websites, web-apps, and am passionate about bringing web technologies into the real world.

## Creativity



I have a degree in Digital Screen Arts, and enjoy using my skills to help clients develop their ideas into something they love.

##
For most of my website projects I use WordPress or Drupal, but I'm also keen to promote the expansion of web technologies beyond the web, like with [Ever After](/portfolio/ever-after) where I created an interactive exhibition running on a series of web pages.

Like acronyms and buzz-words? Here's a list of the main technologies and tools I use:

- PHP
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- Python
- Wordpress
- Drupal
- React
- Vue (with NUXT)
- CSS with SASS/LESS
- Adobe Creative Suite/Cloud
- Gimp/Inkscape
- CLI video editing using FFMPEG and MLT/MELD
- LAMP stack administration
- AWS (S3, RDS, Cloudfront)
- Cloudflare (including Workers/Pages)
- General DNS
