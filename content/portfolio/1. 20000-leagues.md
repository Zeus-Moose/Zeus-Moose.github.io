## Technical details

The whole game is managed with a custom Node-Red dashboard that links the various devices.

I created an audio player in Python which is controlled by MQTT, this can play various ambient sound scapes, music, and sound effects. I also created a web-based video player that is controlled by websockets, this can play looping videos and simultaneously overlay another video using different blending modes.

### Entrance way

- Three separate audio scapes play from different speakers, controlled by websockets.

### Nemo's office

- Zigbee controlled lighting for electrical surge effects and flashing alarms.
- Audio player for looping ambiance and various sound effects. 
- Mumla server to act as an intercom to deliver live messages from Captain Nemo and the crew.

### Atlantis

 - Audio player featuring looping ambiance, various sound effects, and music.
 - Projector displaying a rippling water effect on the ceiling, also triggered to play moving machine parts, and monster shadows.
 - Pi Pico controlled LEDs with custom random pulsing animation to look like otherworldly insects, also pulses red in time with music during escape.
 - Pi Pico controlled UV lamp can be turned on/off or play a short flickering animation.
 - Pi Pico controlled 'tipper' device uses a stepper motor to release four wooden blocks from the ceiling.
