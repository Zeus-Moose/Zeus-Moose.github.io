> An app that allows you to easily create treasure hunts, either in your own area, or anywhere in the world. You can then share the treasure hunt with your friends and family, or make it public for everyone to enjoy!

<p>Once you've finished building your treasure hunt you can share it privately with friends anywhere in the world via a simple link. You can also choose to make it public for anyone to play!</p>

<h3 class="min-section-heading">Play</h3>
<p>All you need to play is a smart phone with GPS. Follow the clues to the locations and the app will tell you if you've found the right place.</p>

### Technical details

The app has two main parts: the front-end React-JS app, and the headless back-end running WordPress.
The React app is a progressive-web-app using CRA for tooling and Semantic UI. Open Street Map is used to provide mapping.
All treasure hunts, users, and pages are securely saved in WordPress using the REST API.
