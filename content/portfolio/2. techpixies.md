### Online Learning Platform

As part of my role as Chief Technology Officer for TechPixies I designed and built an online platform to enable the delivery of training courses around the world. I also taught several face-to-face classes on web design and WordPress.

The main focus of the platform is to allow visitors to purchase courses, track their progress and issue certificates on completion. Course participants can create a profile to share their picture, neighbourhood, skills, and course progress with other participants, this is to encourage networking and peer-to-peer support.

Other website features includes a blog, testimonials, webinars (members-only), and gift certificates.

### Wordpress Course

I also created the curriculum for and taught our six-week course on WordPress site building.

### Technical details

The site is built on Wordpress using the FoundationPress base theme, which I customised. It uses several industry-standard plugins including:

 - WooCommerce
 - LearnDash - provides the basis for all courses, but was substantially customised
 - Gravity Forms
 - Advanced Custom Fields

For the design of the site, I extrapolated brand guidelines from the logo and colours provided by the original designer.

The site uses Gutenberg, the page layout system from WordPress, which I integrated with the theme. This gives content editors much more design freedom and control, whilst ensuring they stay within brand guidelines.
