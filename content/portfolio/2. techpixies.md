> The skills and support I got from TechPixies helped me see my value in the workplace and rediscover my confidence. I'm now back working part time in a great local company.

***TechPixies is an award winning social-enterprise that provides training and life coaching for women looking to return to work, change careers or start a business.***

As part of my role as Chief Technology Officer for TechPixies I designed and built an online platform to enable the delivery of training courses around the world. I also taught several face-to-face classes on web design and WordPress.

</div>

The main focus of the platform is to allow visitors to purchase courses, track their progress and issue certificates on completion. Course participants can create a profile to share their picture, neighbourhood, skills, and course progress with other participants, this is to encourage networking and peer-to-peer support.

Other website features includes a blog, testimonials, webinars (members-only), and gift certificates.

### Technical details

The site is built on Wordpress using the FoundationPress base theme, which I customised. It uses several industry-standard plugins including:

 - WooCommerce
 - LearnDash - provides the basis for all courses, but was substantially customised
 - Gravity Forms
 - Advanced Custom Fields
 - Two factor login - for all admins

For the design of the site, I extrapolated brand guidelines from the logo and colours provided by the original designer.

The site uses Gutenberg, the new page layout system from WordPress, which I integrated with the theme. The full setup gives content editors much more design freedom and control, whilst ensuring they stay within brand guidelines.
