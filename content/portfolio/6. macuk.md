> Excluded young people know what they need and what they want. Why don't we work together to create projects and services that use everyone's skills and expertises?

**To help share awareness of what co-production means in the sector, MacUK created a series of short animated videos based on interviews with young people.**

The site presents several areas of co-production. Clicking on one expands it to show thumbnails for videos on that topic. The video can be played by clicking the thumbnail.

I designed the site based on existing brand guidelines for MacUK, and incorporated some animated transitions to compliment the animation style of the videos.

### Technical details

The site is a static HTML page based on Zurb Foundation.</p><p>The page loads a JSON config file which contains the "topics" each of which includes a title and a list of YoutTube IDs for each video. The page then populates each topic with the corresponding thumbnails. The YouTube API is used to display the video in a pop-up and listen for the video finish event to play the next video under that topic.
