**I'm a senior back-end developer at Substrakt. That means I work with clients to turn their business goals into reliable, performant, and accessible code**


#### Folger - [folger.edu](https://folger.edu/)

I was the lead back-end developer on this large project which was a brand new website for the largest Shakespeare library in the world. The project included integrating five different APIs (play texts, play media, events & tickets, membership, email newsletters), importing over 3,000 articles from five different sources, creating a powerful search tool to search across the whole site and play texts simultaneously.

#### The National Theatre - [www.nationaltheatre.org.uk](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/)

Prior to the launch of their new website, I implemented a series of UX improvements to their booking portal (TNEW) to address issues users were having with signing in, resetting passwords, and streamlining email sign-up

### Technical details

Most projects were built using WordPress and a suite of in-house tools and services to streamline developemnet. This commonly included a page builder, a sync with various ticketing platforms (such as Tessitura and Spektrix), a filterable what-on page, integrated booking platform, and newsletter sign-up.
